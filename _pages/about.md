Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I am an MBA student at [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/) . I completed my master in Public Administration from [Tribhuvan University](http://cdpa.edu.np/). I have worked in various departments for [Nepal Airlines Corporation](https://www.nepalairlines.com.np/) as an administrative assistant. After working for more than 3 and half years, my interest for managing large corporation grew, so I persued MBA and I am loving the process of learning, unlearning, and relearning things.
